Welcome to my second game project for CIS580.

This game is a top down space shooter made using this great asset pack made by Kenney under Creative Commons, please check them out! ->  https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux

This game features collision between the enemy and player ships, and the projectiles fired from both teams. Along with that there are some animated sprite effects for when a shot lands on an opposing teams ship. 

All information regarding licensing and the assets I used can be found in the Assets folder.
